Today's work focused on two projects. Project 22 implemented upvote/downvote functionality for chat messages, improved data querying efficiency by associating user votes, and made several refactoring changes for improved code clarity, security (hiding sensitive data like allowed hosts), and schema consistency.  Project 8 saw significant progress on a script to track and log commits, including enhancements to handle duplicates,  add commit messages, and improve synchronization efficiency through repo name tracking and hashing.  The README files for Project 8 were also updated.
