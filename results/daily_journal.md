### Date: October 26, 2023

**Total Commits:** 1

### Summary of Changes:

The primary focus of today's development was to enhance the flexibility and structure of the chat message content. This was achieved by refactoring the chat schema to utilize a "message parts" system.

### Key Changes:

- **Refactored Chat Schema:**
  - The existing chat schema has been updated to accommodate a more modular approach to message content.
  - Instead of a single field for message content, the schema now uses an array of "message parts."
  - This allows for richer and more varied message structures, supporting different content types within a single message (e.g., text, images, links, custom components).

### Impact:

- **Increased Flexibility:** Developers can now create more dynamic and interactive chat experiences.
- **Improved Extensibility:** The new structure makes it easier to add new types of message content in the future without significant schema changes.
- **Better Content Management:** Individual parts of a message can be managed and rendered independently, leading to more efficient processing and display.

### Commit Details:

- **feat: Refactor chat schema to use message parts for flexible content**
  - This commit introduces the new message parts structure. Specific details about the implementation (e.g., the structure of a message part, supported types) would typically be found in the commit message itself or associated code changes.
